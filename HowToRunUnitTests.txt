When Visual Studio loads the solution, the Karma extension looks for the karma.unit.conf.js file, 
and automatically starts running the tests in the output window.

You can browse to http://localhost:8080, a socket is set up between the nodejs server and the JS unit test file, 
so once you save a js unit test file, the nodejs server is automatically notified and executes all the unit tests again.
